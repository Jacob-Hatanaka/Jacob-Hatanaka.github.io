## Bridge Building

Software engineering, at its core, is similar to the act of building a bridge; One finds a problem in front of them, a river, in this case, and must find a way to cross. You start by analyzing the river, seeing its width, its strength, the height, and plan to build a bridge. Sure you could swim across, but if you know you must cross multiple times, a bridge would surely work better. In this way, I find software engineering very similar to building bridges. You start by analyzing what exactly you are trying to build, its restraints, and how you will build it. Finally, you find yourself finished with an immense feeling of accomplishment. 

## Programming
 
The feeling of solving a problem with a working solution is jubilant. This is joy that gravitates me towards programming; I find myself led to software engineering in the way that it helps create solutions to problems that help you complete a task at much higher efficiency. Thus leading to my interesting in application development. I find myself in the same way led to a more open-faced problem: boredom. The solution? Games. I enjoy games and their immense variety and wish to eventually create something that can help others stave off boredom. 
 
Towards this effort, I hope to develop the skills required to build and create. I hope to learn how to handle and store data. I wish to develop skills in languages like TypeScript to allow work on websites and the like; To learn about the depths required to implement high quality User Interfaces through JavaScript. These skills will boost my ability to craft usable designs of software, be that through helpful applications or games. I hope to develop these in order to become a more well rounded programmer and write better code.
