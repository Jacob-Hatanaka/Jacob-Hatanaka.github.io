## My Experience
I only recently learned Typescript over the past two weeks. I find it to be somewhat different from the languages I’m used to in terms of syntax: Differences in variable & function declaration, different functions and imports, and data type names. Despite this, like most languages, the general method of coding is very similar to what I’m used to. This helped me adapt to the language quickly and get into what really interested me: TypeScript’s significant differences.

## Significant Differences
One significant difference I’ve found is the ability to specify different return types via the ‘|’ operator. This seems very interesting compared to other languages which only allow one return type. This can be used for functions which may relay different information based on subclass differences or parameters. For example, a function could return a requested object if the object is found, while returning false if the object is not found. 

Another difference is in the ability of Mapping Types. This feature allows you to iterate over groups of data, changing the variable’s types and similar data. This seems useful in altering higher levels of data that are usually immutable. This could be applied in changing a set of data to start as mutable; allowing the user to program their own set of configurations for some application, for example. Then the application would set this set of data to be immutable after its initial setting, reducing confusion or bugs. 

## My Thoughts
I enjoyed learning about TypeScript, as it let me learn a new language. I previously had zero experience with JavaScript and therefore TypeScript. The WODs also were helpful in helping flush out my familiarity with TypeScript. They allow you to test your ability with the language while also practicing different scenarios. I believe that overall, learning TypeScript and being able to apply those skills has been very helpful to me. 

Hopefully by sharpening my skills with TypeScript, it’ll both increase my skill in the language and also reflect an improvement in other languages.
