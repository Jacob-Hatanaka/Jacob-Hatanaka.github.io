## Software Engineering

Software engineering consists of some of the most important parts of computer science, including coding ethics, coding standards, and tools used to code.My software engineering class taught me a lot regarding these topics and helped me consolidate my understanding of them. Throughout the course, I practiced many different skills in coding and learned many new coding techniques, including coding databases, websites, using Javascript and Typescript, and navigating the command terminal.

## Beyond the Basics

Despite focusing mainly on coding web applications throughout the class, I learned concepts that persist permanently throughout the coding sphere. These topics include Open Source Software Development and Functional Programming. Open Source Software Development refers to the notion of publicly displaying and showing code that you produce. This allows anyone in the public to view your code and see how each process is done. This is not a concept simply inside of web development, but pertains to the whole of coding. By publicizing code written, it benefits any programmer who wants to learn how to create the same processes and structures you used in your code. This allows the benefit of providing vast sums of information that otherwise would not have been publicly available to anyone who wishes to learn. Functional Programming is the action of using functions within code to produce standardized outputs. Functions are pieces of code which take inputs and give outputs using these inputs. They are incredibly useful due to their reusability throughout your code. Functions are the most basic and important parts of coding in general and exist anywhere in computer science. These allow the vast simplification of code and makes code a lot more readable.

In general software engineering is a great class to take to not only expand your knowledge of web development, but also to get great grasps on concepts used throughout computer science in general.
