ETS Project Organizer

Overview
The problem: Enterprise Technology Services has an issue with listing and viewing project reviews on their website. They find that their current system has no sort of organized rules and regulations, causing discord in creating reviews based on order of components, information included, and general style of each review. 

The solution: Our solution allows for a dynamic review form on our website, which allows users and admins to use forms to organize data. Admins will be able to edit the fields the users fill out in their review creation forms. Users will then be able to fill out forms including all these fields to create a systemized form of review creation. 

Approach
We will approach this problem using the nextjs template as a basis for our design. We will customize the site to allow admins a new page that allows editing of form parameters. The users will only be able to view and create forms. Also, we will allow users who are not signed in to view projects but not submit or edit them. We are primarily using nextjs, postgresql, and javascript in order to easily implement each feature with our partial experience with these tools. 

Use Cases

Our use cases mainly branch into each use case for each type of user (guest, user, and admin).

Overall our use cases will follow these guidelines:
New or default user goes to landing page, goes to project list, selects and views project review
User or admin goes to landing page, goes to create project form, fills out form and submits new project review
Admin goes to landing page, goes to admin page, edits parameters for forms or removes form

Beyond the Basics

After implementing the basic formatting of our app, we have some additional features that can be explored

A way to update all project forms for new parameters added
Default values for parameters
Search system for projects rather than list based on project tabs
Categories and subcategories for forms editable by admins, rather than just a list of parameters to fill out on each form
Quick checks for each parameter on information required
